<h1 >About Me</h1>
<p>My journey into programming began through self-study, which has driven me to explore and discover the exciting world of technology and software development. My curiosity and determination have led me to acquire a solid understanding of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I consistently stay updated with the latest trends in web development and continuously strive to improve my skills. What I enjoy the most is tackling technical challenges and solving problems creatively.</p>


<h1>Laboral Experience and education</h1>
<p>Throughout my coursework, I have had the opportunity to work on various group projects with fellow students. This experience has reinforced my belief that teamwork is essential for a successful web developer. It also introduced me to different tools for remote collaboration.</p>
<p>During my courses, I developed strong self-management, organizational, and time management skills. I successfully completed various tasks by following structured guidelines, allowing me to handle different responsibilities efficiently.</p>
<p>I have taken multiple courses in English, engaging with native-speaking instructors and participating in small courses related to my interests in technology and programming. This has significantly improved my English proficiency, helped me learn technical jargon, and boosted my confidence in speaking.</p>
